# About me (general info)
My name is Ekaterina Tkachenko (or just Katia). I typeset different things for different purposes, but the majority of them are focused on linguistics and linguistics olympiads. This repository represents my typesetting skills. 

**!Attention!** If you want to tell about technical issues or mistakes -- send an email to ```t.kateri@yandex.ru```

## Typesetting
I usually typeset in ```LaTeX```, ```Overleaf``` and ```typst```. However, I have done different things in different programs. So, there is a description of folders' contents.
1. ```LaTeX```
    - Glossing and transcribing Hebrew texts
    - A paper containing linguistic problems on Romance languages
    - Some problems for [Oral Linguistics Olympiad](https://ling.hse.ru/junior/uol) (will be soon)
2. ```Overleaf```
    - Homeworks on syntax (with syntactic trees, exactly)
3. ```typst```
    - A paper containing linguistic problems on child speech
    - A hand-out on analysing the article and comparing its results with real linguistic problems
    - Personal overview on caf√©s in my hometown (just code-file)
