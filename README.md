# About me (general info)
My name is Ekaterina Tkachenko (or just Katia). I am typesetting different things for different purposes, but the majority of them are mostly focused on linguistics and linguistics olympiads. This repository represents my typesetting skills. 

**!Attention!** There will be just PDF-files, but, if you want receive a code-file, send an email to ```t.kateri@yandex.ru```

## Typesetting
I usually typeset in ```LaTeX```, ```Overleaf``` and ```typst```. However, I have done different things in different programs. So, there is a description of folders' contents.
1. ```LaTeX```
    - dd
2. ```Overleaf```
    - dd 
3. ```typst```
    - dd
